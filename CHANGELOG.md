  - `entry_type` in `entry_saved`.
  - Weather metrics and provenance in weather events.
- `IDs_LOCK.md` created with policy, owners, and stable IDs registry.
- `analytics_schema.json` created; `trace_validator.py` updated to validate analytics and to treat analytics params as DD usage.

### Fixed
- Validator integration for `06_Contextual_UX_Guidelines_v1.json` cross-file checks, eliminating prior fatal issues.

### Notes
